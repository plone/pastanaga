## Prerequisits

Before we can start, you need Node.js 6 and the Node package manager (npm) installed. Please check https://nodejs.org for install instructions.
To ease development with multiple Node versions, we recommend to use nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

We will also use the yarn package manager (https://yarnpkg.com/en/) which provides you with repeatable and stable builds, amongst other features. To install yarn globally run:

  $ npm install yarn -g

## Setup

  $ yarn

## Start

  $ yarn start
